# Linux Enumerator

I started this small project because i like to avoid as much as possible [linpeas](https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) for machine enumeration.

This is due mainly for 2 reasons:

1) Avoid detection mechanism:
<br>
Security solution knows very well linpeas beahaviour, so it is important to have something up your sleeve

2) Lighter Enumeration:
<br>
I used linpeas very often in the past and i found most of the output not necessary for 99% of the machines i tested.
With that said, i like to run some enumeration commands and, if i didn't find much, i can run something eavier like LinPeas.
